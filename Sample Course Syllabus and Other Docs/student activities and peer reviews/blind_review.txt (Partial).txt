1. I can imagine that once successfully developed, this model will be beneficial to both academia and ordinary users. This model will definitely be a concrete step toward machine intelligence.

2. It is very good that the state-of-art models was introduced in the proposal. Having some hypothesis about Bidirectional GRU or LSTM is also helpful in determining research directions.

>> State some weaknesses of the project idea

1. This could be a challenging project, since we did not study QA systems and techniques. Without prior study, innovation can be tough.

2. The research question is a little bit too general, which also adds complexity to the project. For example, the type of texts to be learned from is not determined. Expository essays are different from poems in this case.

Project Title: A study of key-phrase extraction on celebrity tweets

Reviewer A >>

The project is about Analyzing the information about the celebrity individuals by extracting the key words from the twitter. To discern the accuracy or precision of the keywords, the group will evaluate through monkey learn, a company that serves to better curate to customers for better marketing, and compare with company’s algorithm result. The project plans on expanding onto more celebrities as the algorithm matures.
The research problem was clearly stated (10). 
Their ideas were interesting (10). 
The strength of the project idea is that there are plenty of celebrities using twitter, and that the texts are short and not as complicated as other forms of text data.
The weakness of the project idea is that it would be a challenge to extract the data if they can’t get the twitter developer account permission. 

Reviewer B >>

The project aims to provide illustrations of celebrity tweets using key-phrase extraction model.

Reviewer D >>

Que>> Summarize the project idea in few sentences.
This research is focused on the key-phrase extraction from a celebrity's Tweets, which is non-scholarly articles. The research would create a word cloud with key-phrases of the Tweets. The research will use the TextRank algorithm to extract.

Que>> State some strengths of the project idea >> It was clear how the research would process from proposal and presentation. 
Que>> State some weaknesses of the project idea
I was not sure about which criteria should be used to select the one celebrity tweeter account within one-month and how to collect students for building the golden standard dataset. It would be better with several celebrities in the beginning phrase if that is possible. There might be personal bias towards key-phrase extraction especially if tweets are from a celebrity.  
If the MonkeyLearn is extracting key-word from commercials and the research was based on non-commercial celebrity, i'm not sure but there might be different criteria.

Reviewer E >>

>> Summarize the project idea in few sentences.

The project’s goal is to extract key phrases from tweets of a chosen celebrity. The project will develop on previous key phrase extraction methods with consideration of synonym word groups. Word clouds are presented as final products.

1. Word clouds are good visual representations that reflect importance/frequencies of words.

2. It is very good to have concrete, detailed steps of the project and additional ideas.

>> State some weaknesses of the project idea

1. This is neither a survey nor an innovative research. Very much of this project is an application of an existing method. In my opinion, there is not enough contribution.

2. Data size is a little bit too small. One celebrity’s tweets within a month can be too few to extract correct key phrases.

Que>> Have they explained clearly why their idea is interesting and impactful to some parties?  10
Que>> State some strengths of the project idea
The project idea is very interesting and is definitely a very powerful idea for QA tasks. 
Que>> State some weaknesses of the project idea
The data format for the NQ dataset is not clearly stated. Are these answers contain only a single word? If not, maybe you should think about another loss function that also counts for synonyms, etc. Since the question-answer pair is open-ended, using cosine similarity as a loss function might be quite unfair. Moreover, there are words that are weighted heavier than others (the, an, etc. are not important). Then it would be great if you can design a loss function that captures this different.

Que>> Summarize the project idea in few sentences: 
Their project focuses on creating a dataset of YouTube transcripts and from each video's transcript they will be extracting the key-phrases from the transcript. Ultimately they have chosen to select around 10 or so keyphrases that they would utilize to describe the video. Upon completing the keyphrase extraction they then would compare it to a goldstandard of human selected keyphrases for each video (which will most likely be self-made by them). The will be limiting their focus on scholarly videos.

It helps to fill in gaps left where user-provided text summaries of YouTube videos fall short, which is definitely a real frustration when searching for specific YouTube videos. It also gives a clear description of what their methods will be and what resources they will utilize.

Que>> State some weaknesses of the project idea 

The domain is a bit too restrictive, and doesn't reflect the general content of YouTube as most of YouTube is not scholarly. It also acknowledges that YouTube's Closed Captioning services are error-prone, but doesn't fully explain how they'll work around that.
